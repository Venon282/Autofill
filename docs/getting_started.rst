Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Install the project dependencies, including Sphinx and the Read the Docs theme::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

To generate the HTML documentation locally, run::

   sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html

The resulting site can be opened by pointing your browser to
``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

Autogenerated API Reference
---------------------------

The API reference is created automatically from the project's docstrings. When
adding new modules, ensure they are exposed through the documentation tree in
``docs/api`` so they appear in the generated site.

Workflow Tutorials
------------------

Step-by-step guides for the preprocessing, conversion, training, inference, and
grid-search utilities are available in :doc:`tutorials`. Review those sections
for detailed command examples that mirror the README instructions.

Data Artefacts
--------------

If you are new to HDF5 or metadata encodings, start with :doc:`data_formats`.
It explains how the conversion scripts build the datasets, what each field
contains, and how to inspect the files with Python before launching a long
training job.
